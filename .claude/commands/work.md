# Work Transaction

**USE THIS BEFORE STARTING ANY IMPLEMENTATION.**

This skill creates the required deciduous nodes BEFORE you write any code. The Edit/Write hooks will BLOCK you if you don't have a recent node.

## Step 1: Create the Goal Node

Based on $ARGUMENTS (or the user's most recent request), create a goal node:

```bash
# Create goal with the user's request captured verbatim
deciduous add goal "$ARGUMENTS" -c 90 --prompt-stdin << 'EOF'
[INSERT THE EXACT USER REQUEST HERE - VERBATIM, NOT SUMMARIZED]
EOF
```

**IMPORTANT**: The prompt must be the user's EXACT words, not your summary.

## Step 2: Announce the Goal ID

After creating the goal, tell the user:
- The goal ID that was created
- What you're about to implement
- That you'll create action nodes as you work

## Step 3: Before Each Major Edit

Before editing files, create an action node:

```bash
deciduous add action "What you're about to implement" -c 85 -f "file1.rs,file2.rs"
deciduous link <goal_id> <action_id> -r "Implementation step"
```

## Step 4: After Completion

When the work is done:

```bash
# After committing
deciduous add outcome "What was accomplished" -c 95 --commit HEAD
deciduous link <action_id> <outcome_id> -r "Implementation complete"

# Sync the graph
deciduous sync
```

## The Transaction Model

```
/work "Add feature X"
    |
Goal node created (ID: N)
    |
Action node before each edit (links to goal)
    |
Implementation happens (Edit/Write now allowed)
    |
git commit
    |
Outcome node with --commit HEAD (links to action)
    |
deciduous sync
```

## Why This Matters

- **Hooks will block you** if no recent action/goal exists
- **Commits will remind you** to link them to the graph
- **The graph captures your reasoning** for future sessions
- **Context recovery works** because the graph has everything

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Start work
deciduous add goal "Feature title" -c 90 -p "User request"

# Before editing (required!)
deciduous add action "What I'm implementing" -c 85
deciduous link <goal> <action> -r "Implementation"

# After committing
deciduous add outcome "Result" -c 95 --commit HEAD
deciduous link <action> <outcome> -r "Complete"

# Always sync
deciduous sync
```

**Now create the goal node for: $ARGUMENTS**
